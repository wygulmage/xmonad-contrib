------- Type Families for XMonad.StackSet -------
-- StackSet uses types like `Screen i l a s sd` when it should probably use monomorphic types like `Screen` with i, l, a, s, and sd instantiated as WorkspaceId, Layout Window, Window, ScreenId, and ScreenDetail, respectively.
-- As a result, the classy lenses use functional dependencies and it's all really ugly and too permissive. The type families below are a sort of stopgap to say what should be what and what their relations are to each other, without breaking existing code.
